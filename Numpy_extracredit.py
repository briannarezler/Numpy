# Two-Player, Two-Dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe

# Write a script to play two-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe between a human player and the computer.
# Use a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array. Each player indicates their moves by entering a pair
# of numbers representing the row and column indices of the square in which they want to place
#  their mark, either an 'X' or an 'O'. When the first player moves, place an 'X' in the
# specified square. With the computer choice, place an 'O' in the specified square.
# Each move must be to an empty square. After each move, determine whether the game has been
# won and whether it’s a draw. Also, allow the player to specify whether he or she wants to
# go first or second.
